// Registry, which tracks all existing peers. The registry, in turn, is used by
// the Client.

// Sending messages to a peer is done via the Send() method, or via the
// Broadcaster helper type. To receive messages from a Peer, use the Receiver
// helper type (by subscribing).
//
// If a peer is entered into the registry, but still being dialed, then it
// exists in an unfinished state, and all its operations will block until it is
// dialed or closed.
